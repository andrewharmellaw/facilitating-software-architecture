# About Andrew Harmel-Law
![Andrew Harmel-Law, the author of Facilitating Software Architecture giving a talk at JFokus, Stockholm, in 2020](/assets/img/andrew-harmel-law.png)

I'm a Tech Principal at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com), specializing in domain-driven design, org design, software and systems architecture, agile delivery, build tools and automation. I'm experienced across the software development lifecycle and in many sectors. 

I'm also an [author and trainer](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/8117) for O'Reilly. I've written one [book about facilitating software architecture](/book/) and one [chapter about implementing the Accelerate/DORA four key metrics](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-metrics/9781098112226/). I also run regular online training sessions in [Domain-Drive Design (First Steps)](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/domain-driven-design-first-steps/0636920436867/) and [Architecture Decision Making by Example](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/architecture-decision-making-by-example/0636920080767/0642572003571/).

What motivates me is the humane delivery and sustainable evolution of large-scale software solutions, that fulfill complex user needs. I understand that people, architecture, process and tooling all have key roles to play in achieving this. 

I have a great passion for open source software and its communities. I have been involved with OSS to a greater or lesser extent since my career began; as a user, contributor, expert group member, or paid advocate - most notably as one of the 
[Jenkins JobDSL](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl/) originators. 

I enjoy sharing my experience as much as possible. This sharing is not only seen in my formal consulting engagements, but also informally through mentoring, [blog posts](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/), [conferences](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa2Mt-TLoPDzemsyhdmCF2w) (keynoting, speaking and organising), and open-sourcing my code.
