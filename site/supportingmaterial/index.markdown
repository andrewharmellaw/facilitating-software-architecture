# Supporting Material for Facilitating Software Architecture
It turns out that when you write a book about architectural practice in the sociotechnical world there is a LOT that can be said. Not all of that made its way into the book, and instead has found safe harbour here. 

The links in this page are structured by chapter, and many of the links in the book connect to these artefacts too. As I collate further supplementary things, I'll put them here for everyones benefit too. And if you have something you thikn others might benefit from, head over to the community and/or drop me a line at <info@facilitatingsoftwarearchitecture.com>.
