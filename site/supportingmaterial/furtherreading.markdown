# Further Reading Around Facilitating Software Architecture

I’d encourage you to take a look at Agile Retrospectives by Esther Derby and Diana Larsen but with a specific focus on the key aspects of empathy and honesty to really get down to underlying, often societal, problems that Sophia Katsaouni pulls out in her talk “Bring Meaning back to your Retrospectives (No Matter Your Role)”. 

Other tools I’ve used to great success have been many of the practices described in Evelyn van Kelle, Gien Verschatse, and Kenny Baas-Schwegler in their book Collaborative Software Design; specifically the chapters “The Influence of Ranking”, “The Impact and Opportunities of Cognitive Bias” and “Resistance and Conflict Resolution”. There is also a great deal in Jitske Kramer’s Jam Cultures that I had no space to fit in. The same goes for Turn the Ship Around! Finally, I’ve had great support with Team Canvasses, and Heidi Helfand’s Dynamic Reteaming also has many great tips and tricks.
