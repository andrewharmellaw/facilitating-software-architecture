# Further Reading Around Facilitating Software Architecture

I’d encourage you to take a look at [Agile Retrospectives](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/agile-retrospectives/9781680500295/) by Esther Derby and Diana Larsen but with a specific focus on the key aspects of empathy and honesty to really get down to underlying, often societal, problems that Sophia Katsaouni pulls out in her Nwecrafts 2024 talk “[Bring Meaning back to your Retrospectives (No Matter Your Role)](https://vimeo.com/949430622 )”. 

Other tools I’ve used to great success have been many of the practices described in Evelyn van Kelle, Gien Verschatse, and Kenny Baas-Schwegler in their book [Collaborative Software Design](https://www.manning.com/books/collaborative-software-design); specifically the chapters “The Influence of Ranking”, “The Impact and Opportunities of Cognitive Bias” and “Resistance and Conflict Resolution”. There is also a great deal in Jitske Kramer’s [Jam Cultures](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jam-Cultures-Inclusion-Conversation-Decisions/dp/9462763585) that I had no space to fit in. The same goes for [Turn the Ship Around!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Turn-Ship-Around-Building-Breaking/dp/1591846404) Finally, I’ve had great support with [Team Canvasses](https://theteamcanvas.com/), and Heidi Helfand’s [Dynamic Reteaming](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/dynamic-reteaming-2nd/9781492061281/) also has many great tips and tricks.
