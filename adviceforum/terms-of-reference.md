# An Example Architecture Advice Forum Terms of Reference

## Background
The Architecture Advice Forum (AAF) is a key part of the decentralized approach to lightweight architectural governance at [YOUR_COMPANY].

## Objectives and Benefits
The Advice Forum provides a cross-[YOUR_COMPANY] forum for sharing and offering advice on in-flight architectural decisions as per the [Architectural Advice Process](LINK-TO-DEFINITION). This will be an efficient way to provide the widest awareness of, and input into, these decisions, as well as providing a learning forum for all software teams, and beyond.

## Scope
All upcoming ADRs (DRAFT and PROPOSED statuses) will be shared. The status of previously shared architectural decisions will also be tracked.

Other decisions (e.g. product) will not be brought to this forum, though they may inform decisions in this forum. 

## Constraints and Risks
The forum will meet weekly for an hour maximum. If this time is insufficient to cover all raised decisions then collaboration will take place asynchronously before and after the session. The focus will be on suitable decisions, broad awareness and learning.

There is a risk that key voices in this session will not be heard and therefore breadth, depth and health of participation will be tracked and nurtured by the conveners.

## Assumptions and Dependencies
In-flight decisions will be written up as Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) before sharing at the Advice Forum. All advice provided in the Advice Forum will be recorded in the relevant ADR. Advice may also be gathered outside the Advice Forum, but will still be recorded in the relevant ADR. Deciders will take decisions after Advice Forum sessions.  

Roles
Attendance will be open to all, as will associated collaboration channels and wiki spaces. Standing invitees will be representatives from all software delivery teams (at least dev leads or delegates but also QAs, POs etc.), representatives from Infra, UX, Product, Data, Compliance, Risk Management and Infosec. The Director of Engineering, or a nominated delegate will convene AAFs.

Deliverables
* [Minutes](LINK-TO-THIS) - prepared ahead of the Advice Forum listing all ADRs to discuss as well as any other business attendees wish to raise. Also records any actions arising. 
* [ADR library](LINK-TO-THIS) - showing all the ADRs brought to the Advice Forum and their statuses.
