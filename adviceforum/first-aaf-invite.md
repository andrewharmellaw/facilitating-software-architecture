Hi all,

You are invited to the first [YOUR_ORGANIZAION] Architectural Advice Forum. Going forward it'll have a weekly cadence, and allow us to experiment with a new way for all teams to make great architectural decisions, share information, and learn - at pace.

The first half of this session will be to go through the overall architectural governance process and answer questions.  Then we'll drop back to what will be our standard agenda:

* Seeking and offering advice on in-flight ADRs [LINK TO YOUR ADR LIBRARY]
* Any other business

(A wiki-based agenda will be shared in advance of each meeting so people can add links to their in-flight ADRs for discussion.)

Looking forward to seeing you all there. If you have time in advance, please take a look at the linked library page above as it explains things in greater detail.

Kind regards, [YOUR_NAME]
