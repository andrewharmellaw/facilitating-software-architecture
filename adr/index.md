## ADR Template from the Book
The [ADR template](adr-template.md) from the book.

## Examples from the Book
Chapter 6 of [Facilitating Software Architecture](https://facilitatingsoftwarearchitecture.com/) by Andrew Harmel-Law has two example Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). 

 * The first example is [a completed ADR](ADR002-Shorten-inventory-ids-with-naonoid.md).
 * The second example shows how an ADR changes as it is written (the file changes name as the ADR does):
     * When it's named ["ADR003-Changing-subscription-payment-details"](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/facilitating-software-architecture/commits/fcbafdaea65e64a1a3dd1d344a30b95ac08e28ef/adr/ADR003-Changing-subscription-payment-details.md?browsing_rename_history=true&new_path=adr/ADR003-Change-subscription-mandates-without-costing-the-customer-or-the-company-money.md&original_branch=example-adr-changesets)
     * When it's named [ADR003-How-do-we-handle-subscription-changes-so-the-customer-isnt-mischarged](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/facilitating-software-architecture/commits/0453a6b2c55166a320b5dbd5f0ca197085641ee5/adr/ADR003-How-do-we-handle-subscription-changes-so-the-customer-isnt-mischarged.md?browsing_rename_history=true&new_path=adr/ADR003-Change-subscription-mandates-without-costing-the-customer-or-the-company-money.md&original_branch=example-adr-changesets)
     * When its named ["ADR003-Change-subscription-mandates-without-costing-the-customer-or-the-company-money"](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/facilitating-software-architecture/commits/example-adr-changesets/adr/ADR003-Change-subscription-mandates-without-costing-the-customer-or-the-company-money.md)
