# Example Tech Radar from Facilitating Software Architecture
Chapter 11 of [Facilitating Software Architecture](https://facilitatingsoftwarearchitecture.com/) by Andrew Harmel-Law has a worked example of creating a tech radar using a GDocs spreadsheet. 

A read-only version of this spreadsheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tUUfw15xRk8e89cL8mLrZnD4EVTrVWI6I-G8wMCnjAE/edit?gid=621491407#gid=621491407).

The published example radar can be browsed [here](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?documentId=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F14DJ0vVmytnVlJ8qcqsMyxsVvErus-p6XpuLkA0gQ814%2Fedit%3Fgid%3D582933419%23gid%3D582933419). (If it doesn't work, and just spins endlessly, it might be a plugin you have in your browser. In that case try incognito mode.)
